# Piazza Splash Page Challenge
[Live Site](https://ckane30691.github.io/splash-page-challenge/#/)

## Technologies Used:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for building user interfaces
  * I chose to use React because of its ability to do virtual dom diffing and it's overall speed and performance.  Also, React is used internally by Facebook so they have firsthand knowledge of, and are quick to solve, bugs; unlike Angular which was created as an experiment by Google but was never actually put into production internally by them.  I chose to build this page out as if I was building a complete application, therefore there are some extra pieces to this app that aren't strictly necessary but that you would want the moment you start building any actual feature.
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) - Frontend architecture for giving apps a predictable state
  * Again inclusion of this is not strictly necessary but I wanted to demonstrate how I would go about building this out if it were part of a larger application.  Also, if for some reason, I ever wanted to add to more features to this project, it would be trivial to add them with the skeleton I've created around the splash page.
